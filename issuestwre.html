<div class="twparagraph">
    It truly is simple: Trans Women are Women. We have been stigmatized, shamed, illegalized (literally), fetishized, and abused, but triumphant we rise because being a woman in a patriarchal world is pain, and it is not the exception when it comes to Trans Women. In layman's terms: Trans Women just form part of the broader category that is being a woman: there are short women, fat women, black women, tall women, trans women, blonde women, etc.—it truly is simple, it is just a descriptor, not an exclusionary term. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We face significant discrimination in many areas of life and physical/sexual violence and hate crimes. We are always the fantasy and the shame; CisHet White en like to think they dont don't understand their attraction to us (even though we are just women), and that is why our community is under constant attack. 
    <br>
    <br>
    In the United States, discrimination is particularly severe towards trans women who are members of a racial minority, who often face the intersection of transphobia and racism.
    <br>
    <br>
    The term transgender woman is not always interchangeable with transsexual woman (and this term should NOT be used if you are not trans yourself), Transgender is an umbrella term that includes different types of gender variant people but most importantly, it is NOT a choice. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Nobody, in their right mind, would choose to live life as the hardest thing on this Earth: being a trans woman—because even trans men have a LOT more privilege than us. This life is our destiny, not our choice—do not get me wrong, we do love being women, though.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let’s stand together, as sisters, and face the world head-on; once we compare our experiences, we will quickly realize we are one in the same: sisters.
